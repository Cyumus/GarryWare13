# GarryWare13 DEV BRANCH

This branch is only meant for development purposes. No one should use it as it may contain several Lua errors

The objective of this branch is to create a lighter and less clientside-driven code, as well as removing all unnecessary usermessages, replacing the needed ones for more functional systems and providing a better singleplayer support.
